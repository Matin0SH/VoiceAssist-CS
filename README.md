# 🧠 NLP Projects – Text, Bots & All That Cool Stuff

Welcome to my NLP playground! This repo is a collection of my experiments, projects, and random brain dumps in the world of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. From chatbot logic to text preprocessing pipelines and everything in between — it's all here. Some polished, some... not so much (but that's how learning goes, right? 😅).

## 🔍 What's Inside

Here’s what you might find in this repo (subject to chaotic updates):

- 🤖 **Chatbots** – Rule-based and ML-driven bots. Some sassy, some helpful.
- 🧼 **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, custom pipelines, and other NLP hygiene tasks.
- 🧪 **Experiments** – Trying out different models (BERT, TinyLlama, etc.), embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.), and fine-tuning strategies.
- 🧵 **Text Classification** – Spam detection, sentiment analysis, intent recognition, etc.
- 📚 **Notebooks & Scripts** – A mix of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, depending on my mood and caffeine level.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (obviously)
- scikit-learn, spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face 🤗, fastText, Transformers
- Streamlit (for building quick UIs)
- Jupyter Notebook (aka the lab)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is under active development. Some things might be broken, outdated, or weirdly named. If something doesn't make sense, it probably made sense at 2AM when I wrote it.

## 🤝 Contributions

Not really expecting contributions, but if you’re vibing with any part of this and want to fork/PR/tweak, go for it. Just keep it chill and constructive.
